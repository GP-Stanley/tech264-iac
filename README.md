# What is IaC?
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a way to **manage and provision computer data centers through machine-readable definition files**, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. 
* With IaC, organisations can define their infrastructure in a text file, which can be version controlled and deployed automatically using tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Chef
  
> Think of it like writing code to set up and manage your servers, networks, and other infrastructure, instead of doing it manually.

<br>

## Benefits of IaC
* **Consistency**: Ensures that the same environment is created every time, reducing errors.
* ‚è©üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è**Speed**: Automates the setup process, making it much faster.
* üìà**Scalability**: Easily replicate environments across different locations.
* **Version Control**: Track changes and revert to previous configurations if needed.
* üíµü´∞üèª**Cost Efficiency**: Reduces manual labor and potential downtime.

<br>

### Detailed Benefits of IaC
* **Version Control**: Infrastructure definitions can be version controlled, which provides traceability and accountability for infrastructure changes. 
  * Version control systems enable you to see who made the changes, when they made them, and what changes were made.
* **Reusability**: IaC enables organisations to reuse code for infrastructure components like servers, databases, and networks. 
  * This helps to reduce duplication of effort and increases efficiency.
* **Consistency**: Infrastructure definitions can be tested and validated before deployment, which ensures consistency in the environment. 
  * This helps to prevent issues caused by manual configuration errors.

<br>

### Key Benefits of IaC and CI/CD for Customers
* **Faster Time-to-Market**: IaC and CI/CD enable organisations to deploy changes quickly, which helps to reduce the time it takes to bring new features to market. 
  * This enables organisations to remain competitive and meet customer

* **Improved Quality**: IaC and CI/CD enable organisations to test changes automatically, which helps to identify issues early in the development process. 
  * Automated testing ensures that code changes meet the required quality standards before they are deployed to production. 
  * This reduces the risk of defects, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues.

* **Reduced Costs**: IaC and CI/CD help to reduce costs by automating repetitive tasks and reducing manual effort. 
  * This helps to minimise the time and effort required for infrastructure and software deployments. 
  * Automation also helps to reduce the risk of human error, which can lead to costly downtime and remediation efforts.

* **Increased Agility**: IaC and CI/CD enable organisations to be more agile by providing the ability to make changes quickly and efficiently. 
  * With IaC, infrastructure changes can be made in a matter of minutes or hours, compared to days or weeks with manual processes. 
  * This enables organisations to respond to market changes and customer feedback more quickly and efficiently.

<br>

## When/Where to Use IaC
IaC is useful whenever you need to **manage infrastructure**, especially in environments that require frequent updates or scaling. 

Where to use IaC:
* **Time Saver**: You need to think about 'how much time is this going to save me?'. Is it worth investing the time? 
  * Creating Images.
  * CLI Commands that you can run manually. You could put these commands into a script that runs the commands for you. 
* **Cloud environments**: Automating the setup of cloud resources.
* **Development and testing**: Quickly setting up consistent environments for developers and testers.

### Configuration management tools
* Helps **automate** the **management and tracking** of IT **infrastructure**, ensuring consistency and reliability across different environments.
  * Ansible.
  * Puppet. 
  * Chef. 

> Configuration management tools are like helpers that make sure all the parts of your IT setup (like servers, databases, and networks) are set up correctly and stay that way.

| **Tool**      | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ansible**   | Known for its simplicity and ease of use, Ansible automates software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. |
| **Chef**      | Focuses on configuration management and automation, using a Ruby-based DSL (domain-specific language) for writing configuration scripts. |
| **Puppet**    | Provides configuration management and deployment automation, using a declarative language to define system configurations. |

<br>

### Why Are They Important?
* **Automation**: They automate the process of setting up and managing your IT infrastructure, so you don‚Äôt have to do everything manually.
* **Consistency**: They ensure that everything is set up the same way every time, which helps avoid mistakes.
* **Reliability**: They keep track of changes and make sure everything works smoothly across different environments (like development, testing, and production).

### How Do They Work?
* **Define Configurations**: You write down how you want your infrastructure to be set up using a specific language or tool.
* **Apply Configurations**: The tool takes your instructions and sets up the infrastructure accordingly.
* **Manage Changes**: If you need to make changes, the tool helps you update the setup without breaking anything.

<br>

## Orchestration tools
* Orchestration tools help you **manage** and **automate** the **setup and coordination** of your IT **infrastructure**. 
  
> Think of them as the conductors of an orchestra, making sure all the different parts (like servers, databases, and networks) work together smoothly.
### Terraform
* **Description**: Terraform is an open-source tool developed by HashiCorp. 
  * It allows you to define and manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers using a declarative configuration language (HCL - HashiCorp Configuration Language).
* **Use Cases**: Ideal for multi-cloud environments, infrastructure provisioning, and managing resources like servers, databases, and networking.

### AWS CloudFormation
* **Description**: AWS CloudFormation is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps you model and set up your AWS resources. 
  * It uses templates to describe the resources and their dependencies so you can launch and configure them together as a stack.
* **Use Cases**: Automating the setup of AWS resources, managing complex environments, and ensuring consistent deployments.

### Ansible
* **Description**: Ansible is primarily a configuration management tool but can also be used for orchestration.
  * It uses a simple, human-readable language (YAML) to describe automation jobs, which can include provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment.
* **Use Cases**: Automating repetitive tasks, orchestrating multi-tier deployments, and managing configurations across different environments.

<br>

### Why Use Orchestration Tools?
* **Consistency**: Ensures that your infrastructure is set up the same way every time.
* **Efficiency**: Saves time by automating repetitive tasks.
* **Scalability**: Makes it easier to manage large and complex environments.

<br>

### Declarative and Imperative
| **Type**               | **Description**                                                                 | **Examples**                                                                                     |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Declarative IaC Tools** | These tools specify the desired end state of the infrastructure, and the tool automatically configures it to match that state. | Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager, Google Cloud Deployment Manager |
| **Imperative IaC Tools**  | These tools specify the exact steps needed to achieve the desired configuration. | Ansible, Chef, Puppet, SaltStack

# What is Configuration Management (CM)?
* Configuration Management (CM) is a process for **maintaining the consistency** of a product‚Äôs **performance**, **functional**, and **physical attributes** with its **requirements**, **design**, and **operational information** throughout its life. 
* It helps ensure that systems perform as expected and can be easily managed and updated.

<br>

# What is Provisioning of Infrastructure? Do CM Tools Do It?
* Provisioning of infrastructure involves **setting up the necessary hardware** and **software** to **support applications**. 
* This includes servers, storage, networking, and more. 
  * Some CM tools, like Ansible and Chef, can also handle provisioning by automating the setup of these resources.

<br>

# What is Ansible and How Does It Work?
* Ansible is an **open-source tool** used for **IT automation**, including **configuration management**, **application deployment**, and **task automation**. 
* It works by **connecting to your nodes** (servers, devices, etc.) and **pushing out small programs** called ‚ÄúAnsible modules‚Äù **to perform tasks**. 
  * These modules are executed over SSH, and the results are returned to the Ansible server.
* An Ansible playbook is a file written in YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) that defines a series of tasks to be executed on your managed nodes (servers, devices, etc.). 
  * Playbooks are used to automate and manage configurations, deployments, and other IT tasks.

<br>

## How Does Ansible Work?
1. **Connecting to Nodes**
   * Ansible connects to your nodes (which can be servers, devices, or any other infrastructure components) using SSH (Secure Shell). 
   * This means you don‚Äôt need to install any special software on the nodes themselves.
2. **Pushing Ansible Modules**
   * Ansible uses small programs called ‚Äúmodules‚Äù to perform tasks. 
   * These modules are pushed out to the nodes from the Ansible server (also known as the control node).
3. **Executing Modules**
   * The modules are executed on the nodes over SSH. This means Ansible can run commands and scripts on the nodes to perform the required tasks.
4. **Returning Results**
   * After executing the modules, the results are sent back to the Ansible server. 
   * This allows you to see what changes were made and if there were any issues.

<br>

## Key Features of Ansible:
* **Agentless**: Unlike some other tools, Ansible doesn‚Äôt require any agents to be installed on the nodes. 
  * It uses SSH for communication, which simplifies the setup and reduces overhead.
* **Declarative Language**: Ansible uses a simple, human-readable language called YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) to define automation tasks. 
  * This makes it easy to write and understand the automation scripts.
* **Idempotent**: Ansible ensures that running the same task multiple times will produce the same result. 
  * This means you can safely re-run your automation scripts without worrying about unintended changes.

### Example Use Cases:
* **Provisioning**: Setting up new servers and configuring them with the necessary software and settings.
* **Configuration Management**: Ensuring that all servers have the same configuration and are up-to-date.
* **Application Deployment**: Automating the deployment of applications to different environments (development, testing, production).
* **Orchestration**: Coordinating complex workflows and processes across multiple systems.

<br>

## Key Features of Ansible Playbooks
#### Declarative Syntax
* Playbooks use a simple, human-readable syntax in YAML, making them easy to write and understand.

#### Tasks and Plays
* A playbook consists of one or more ‚Äúplays.‚Äù Each play maps a group of hosts to a set of tasks.
* Tasks are the individual actions that Ansible performs, such as installing a package, starting a service, or copying a file.

#### Modules
* Tasks in a playbook use Ansible modules, which are small programs that perform specific actions. 
  * For example, the yum module can install packages on a Red Hat-based system.

#### Idempotency
* Playbooks are designed to be idempotent, meaning that running the same playbook multiple times will produce the same result without causing unintended changes.

## How Ansible Playbooks Work
1. **Define the Playbook**
   * You write a playbook in YAML, specifying the hosts to target and the tasks to perform.

2. **Execute the Playbook**
   * You run the playbook using the ansible-playbook command. 
   * Ansible connects to the specified hosts over SSH and executes the tasks in the order they are written.

3. **Modules Execution**
   * Each task calls an Ansible module, which performs the specified action on the target hosts. The results are then returned to the Ansible server.

<br>

## Ansible Controller (Control Node)
*  The **controller** (also known as the control node) is the **machine where Ansible is installed** and **from** which you **run your automation tasks**. 

### Role of the Controller:
* The controller is the central point from which you manage your infrastructure.
* It runs the Ansible commands and playbooks, connecting to your managed nodes (servers, devices, etc.) over SSH.

### Key Functions:
* **Executing Playbooks**
  * The controller reads and executes the playbooks you write, sending tasks to the managed nodes.

* **Managing Inventory**
  * The controller maintains an inventory of the nodes it manages. 
  * This inventory can be a simple text file listing the nodes or a more dynamic source like a cloud provider‚Äôs API.

* **Connecting to Nodes**
  * The controller uses SSH to connect to the managed nodes. 
  * This means you don‚Äôt need to install any special software on the nodes themselves.

* **Running Modules**
  * The controller sends small programs called modules to the nodes to perform specific tasks. 
  * These modules are executed on the nodes, and the results are sent back to the controller.

<br>

# Who is Using IaC and Ansible in the Industry?
* **Tech giants** like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft for managing their vast cloud infrastructures.
* **Financial institutions** for ensuring secure and consistent environments.
* **Healthcare** providers for managing sensitive data and compliance.
* **Startups** for quickly scaling their infrastructure as they grow.
